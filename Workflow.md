### Agenda

WHY have a meeting? Realistically, we aim for 25 minutes on the syllabi ... but introductions + Q/A are highly desirable to start off ... after thhat we'll spend some time on  the agenda/syllabi ... and close with at least ten minutes remaining for general discussion and comments, ie *for the good of the order*
