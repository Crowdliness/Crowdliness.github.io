Open source is FREE ... not as in free beer or stuff that is given away, but truly FREE as in EXTENSIBLE.

### Discipline Equals Freedom

Unless we actually use, test, refactor, break, debug, improve the source, we are not very disciplined. 

Discipline in a coding sense means [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) the heck out of the source of everything in the tools and workflow that we depend upon ... dogfooding the extensible open souce tool chain for peer led study groups is a pre-requisite part of the game in doing *pure* science.

### List of Repos

The purpose of the [py for Copilot repository](https://github.com/BrunoScience/CopilotPy) is to store ruinable Python programs ... *which I will try to ruin by monkeying around with Github Copilot.*
