# Developer Hero

This whole thing is really a manual or collection of curated lists for Developer Heros ... written by an aspiring Developer Hero, who is attempting to become more crowd savvy ... of course, the repo is completely forkable, you can fork/extend/write your own manual on becoming a Developer Hero

## Commitizen

The Commitizen should be thought of as the Developer Hero's closest disciples, but the Developer Hero has to be more than just a guy who writes code, the Developer Hero really need to replicate a set of new Developer Heroes. 

The Commitizen is that they put their thumbs on the table, risking getting their thumbs hammered ... they publicly COMMIT.

## Contributing

Not just Contributing but AWESOME Contributing and still more and more AWESOME Contributing.  

Contributing is all about direct, intense, regular involvement.

Contributions come from solidly INVOLVED people who NEED to contribute in order to fulfill some sort of need that is directly tied to The Why of their lives

However, it is a matter of contributing to something that is only TIED TO The Why, it is not actually The Why of their lives *currently* or *yet* ... the Contributors are a larger group of people who might be investigating the effort and deciding whether they really want to be Commitizens or eventually Develop Heros.

## Financing

Not necessarily crowdfunding or some sort of subscription model to sustain the effort, but maybe those ... maybe other ways of supporting at a distace. 

Financial participation is SEPARATE FROM being a Commitizen or Contributing or the ways that involve direct, intense, regular, at least weekly, personal commitment ... but does involve requesting small amoounts of financial support.

Beware of the parasitic VCs, angel investors and other funders who want to *get in on the ground floor* of something in order to hijack or change its direction, but don't really share its goals or its ethos.

Remember, you will not need ANY money to attract GOOD crowds; you will need large sums of money to attract the SUCKERS and IDIOTS to SCALE the damned thing.

## Scaling the DAMNED thing

Understand why scaling involves turning the thing the crowd built into a mere product ... it's important to see why productization can easily turns the corner toward damnation ... toward EVIL.

If scaling is done wrong ... and it's almost impossible to get right ... the product can stop being about the project vision that the Developer Hero and Commitizens wanted to build, and instead ALL becomes about Marketing, about drawing in the SUCKERS and IDIOTS who just FOLLOW crowds ... because they don't want to think; they just want to go where the cool kids are going.

## Managing@Scale

Growing pains.

## Renewal@Scale

Continual revolution and accelerating continual improvement is still really about building shareholder value and building the sustaining instutional culture of growth. ***The fun ain't over yet.***

## Institutionalization

It's about ATTRACTING the RIGHT talent, RIGHT investors, RIGHT partners, even RIGHT customers to be involved ... and just saying NO to the wrong ones.

## Adult Governance

At this point, it's entirely about RELIABILITY, RELIABILTY, RELIABILITY.

## Decline or Senescence

It's really about maintaining shareholder value, paying dividends ... in light of changing technology or changing culture ... maintaining reliability for old customers and others who do not really want change or innovation, they just want to count on their old thing.

## Fall

It's STILL about looking forward.  What do you want to be the legacy of your efforts ... AFTER the fall ... AFTER the crowd has moved on to bigger and better things.
