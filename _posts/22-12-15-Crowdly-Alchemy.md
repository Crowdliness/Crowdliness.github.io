# The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go

FREEDOM is about extensibility ... free markets increase FREEDOM through crowdliness ... as value is created, the crowd expands the precedents of freedom and develops soft power as more people understand what value the extensible innovation and surging crowdliness bring to their lives. 

Innovation does not come from one inventor ... it takes thousands, even millions. The myth of one person inventing the patentable idea and changing the world is an outright lie which EGOTISTICAL tell themselves as they imagine in their self-decieving EGOTISTICAL fashion that they can be that inventive hero who gets the credit for inventing The X.

The X ... if it was actually THE X which changed the world ... was invented by a crowd.

Invention requires a crowd.

Every invention EVER has come from crowds of inventive tinkerers developing, imitating, riffing, tinkering ... perhaps, the inventor imagines that the inventor is working alone, HEROICALLY, in total isolation ... but the reality is that no idea is ever able to *take off* until there is crowd of fellow tinkerers who have tinkered enough with similar ideas that they understand why and how the new idea IS *the solution* they have been after.

It is the crowd of autodidactic, informed tinkerers who can actually *get it* and collecively settle on the new crowdly invention which solves the riddle. THEN, as that invention is refined by the smaller crowd of tinkerers, product developers and investors ... the new product emerges which fills a need that people did not previously really know they had ... as people play with the new crowd-generated invention, more development attentions is attracted ... the crowdly process of innovation is about inventions that leads to leads crowds of interest which leads rapid cycles of simultaneously happening invention ... which gathers steam and becomes a larger trend ... the theme of the innovative invention become movement of similar innovations ... as the movement spring into existence, related fairs, hubs, auctions, trading exchanges, brokers, traders and markets come into being.

An example of the type of thing that springs into existence would be something like the [source code hosting repositories and version-control software in development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_source-code-hosting_facilities) or the development of either similar things for models and data sets like the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index) or slightly different things like [pre-print archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_preprint_repositories) or [academic databases and search engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_databases_and_search_engines).

The nature of crowdliness is that it is necessarily uncertain ... and the crowds of artistic inventors are necessarily working [together, but alone] in unpredictable territory.
## The goal of education is predictabilty; this comes at a cost to freedom.

Human language ... as an example of something free, developed in crowds, constantly evolving ... language is diverse, ambiguous, rambunctious, creative, always changing, always destroying old patterns of meaning by creating new, exciting and better patterns of meaning ... but there are hard, discernable patterns which do emerge and become not just established, but entrenched ... in fact, children are taught grammatical patterns so that tests can be divised so that parents and teachers can see that children are no longer wild, babbling bar bar barbarians -- it's important that patterns of language use are testable, so that inculcation can be measured, children can credentialled as having been measurably educated and funding for classroom indoctrination can continue based on performance according to arbitray standards.  

Of course, rule-based and template-based approaches can never take all the possibilities and exceptions of something crowdly like human language into account. Accordingly, machine learning language translation tools today work reasonably well on establish language. But, we should understand that machine language translation has been under extremely heavy, well-funded development for well over seven decades are still not far from perfect ... it took the field of computational machine learning began as a way of understanding code used in signal transmissions ... so machine language language translation has been a *thing* since at least the early 1940s ... well in place before the particularly famous [Georgetown-IBM experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown%E2%80%93IBM_experiment) as well as other not-so-famous, secretive research in signals intelligence and ***code breaking***. 

Machine translation of language SHOULD be seen as being astonishingly useful ... it IS ... but we should not forget the countless amounts of time by very highly-skilled people and unimaginable amounts of money spent on different projects to get machine translation to the state that langauge translation now is. Of course, this is still very much a remarkable achievement, but it is worth asking if the enterprise perhaps took a lot longer than it needed to, because the machine learning and cognitive AI approach was so heavily supervised and constrained by expert opinion ... effectively dominating all research funding into how language, linguistics and even human cognition *should* work ... and as all designers of compilers and microprocessors will understand, these preconceptions about [mis]representations of language necessarily impacted the underlying assumptions of how humans use machines to do computation. 

The take home lesson of machine learning in language translation is that **crowds of unconstrained, FREE users FINALLY rescued us from the taxpayer-funded experts.** *Crowdliness matters.*

## Does crowdliness transcend the boundaries of education?



All markets convey information, but emergent new markets, even black markets and illicit trade are about what might be more important information or knowledge that preoccupies people. Innovation in things like free open source or free markets is the key subject of crowdliness. ***The virtual realm RADICALLY increaseas the promotion of innovation*** because it makes it possible to develop and share ideas and prototypical concepts in a manner which the failure of the experiment is relatively inexpensive or survivable ... of course, the [***embarrassment*** of riches in the virtual realm](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/an+embarrassment+of+riches) means that people are presented with an embarrassingly massive array of choices and growth in that array of choices, in which ideas competitively vie for the crowd's attention span. 

The study of crowdliness begans with how crowds initiate and then develop ... eventually leading to events, bazaars and fairs ... than then greater commitments of time and resources such as participating the accelerated group negotiation that we find in auction, exchanges and secondary markets. It's about the distillation of information into knowledge, then shared knowledge as people learning of new thing, find that it fills an important need they did not realize was there ... then takes off as product because there too many other people who really needed something like that to work ... growth in crowdliness is also about second, third, fourth, fifth and nth waves of refining revisions or new spins which take away the problems and made *The Thing* driving crowdliness work a lot better. 

The study of crowdliness aims for something deeper than just gathering intelligence on why somthing is trending ... it's sort of about what causes people to put more skin in the game ... then through their attention, attendance, bidding, purchases, possibly investments or related accoutrement, the crowd establishes that something is "a thing" ... market participants generally convey incredibly useful information about the productivity of innovations and generally lead to accelerating the pace of development and the intensity of building of productive, ie return-generating, knowledge.

The study of crowdliness is about the genesis of the precursor developments of the microfoundations of microeconomics ... which means that analysis of the data takes us into areas like knowledge representation, [computational semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_semiotics), [knowledge graphs for representation and reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) and maybe even some of the fractal geometry and mathematics of emergent patterns underpinning [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory).

It's mostly also about making an effort to understand how waves or quanta of information course through interconnected markets and especially the part of the larger crowd comprised of shrewd, but early adopters, the key supporters who use the betas and possibly invest, refine or shape new innovations successfully.

In other words, the economics of crowdliness is about making the very best of living in some extremely exciting times ... as we move into an embarrassingly internetworked, massively social-network-of-social-networks, hybrid human-machie information-weighing marketplace of marketplaces ... how can we experience life more creatively, more experimentally, more joyfully.

There's plenty of room for debate, of course, but the pro-Crowdliness point-of-view is inherently optimistic and [positivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism) in its outlook ... the stance is something like "Let's see if we can make this work." RATHER than to first think in terms of resisting change or focusing solely problems and to fight in some sort of quixotic campaign against shadows of windmills that remind of us of an evil opposing knight.   

It is a strictly a matter of thinking something like "Well, okay, then. GOOD! That looks like it's the way it is, then!" 

## Maybe "should" is a word that *SHOULD* be banished from human vocabulary

Pythonic thinking ... or, perhaps we should say the philosophical approach behind the entire human-first progamming language design push of the ABC language which led to Python ... is fundamentally about not pushing humans away from their humanity ... Python is a high-level language that is relatively simple to understand and use -- or at least, Python is about as simple as it can be and still have the ability to interacted with hardware through the abstractions possible of the compiler and build system which uses well-structured, but human-readable code to produce something that executes pretty rapidly on a machine ... when the usage is high enough to justify the extra programmer time, Python programs can transformed into C language OR, in principle, could be implemented directly in silicon as ASIC or other specialized chip ... but THE POINT of Python is to enable Pythonic thinking, to lower the barrier to entry -- so that scientists and engineers who have other things to focus on do not need to focus on C or assembly language or EE hardware design.

It's particularly idiotic to think that people ***should*** learn to think like machines. Machines should be designed to serve humans -- but mostly humans have to survey the landscape of the virtual realm and make the best of the opportunities presented ... particularly when there's such an embarrassment of riches in the opportunity-sphere of the virtual realm.

Regret of the path not taken or any kind of longing for the past is too heavy of a burden to carry ... as we examine the data of crowdliness, we should resist the urge to supervise the learning in the models ... we *should* err on the side of letting the structure of the data as it is form our views what the data are showing us, what patterns in the structure of the data are revealing themselves [in spite of our tendencies to see what we wish to see].

Crowdliness is primarily observational; trying to better or more freely observe, to look at the horizon ahead, rather than to look in the rear view mirror ... about gathering data sources, wrangling data and finding better ways to parse and evaluate the data ... without imposing too many constraints or supervising the data too much ...  it more about [computational semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_semiotics) and [knowledge representation and reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) than it is about imposing any sort of economic modeling or optimization point of view.

NOBODY can really control what the Crowd is going to do; it is probably even deeply immoral to suggest what anyone in the crowd *should* do ... it is best to assume that every other human being is going to do what that human being is going to -- the ONLY way to influence is WITHOUT advocating ANY form of coercion, including government-enforced policy but instead to work on an example of DISCIPLINE. 

Crowdliness is therefore entirely anti-terrorism, anti-political, anti-celebrity ... and completely about personal DISCIPLINE and example.

This system of belief rejects ANY and ALL sorts of preachiness as being a complete waste of time ... it is antithetical to any form of technophobia or [Ludditism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) or especially any of the radically anti-technology [points of view heavily influencing the Unabomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unabomber_Manifesto#Influences) ... in spite of OR maybe even BECAUSE of the whining ... ***The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go***.

## Get used to the fact that you will be telemeterized, unless you are willfully anonymous. 

Whether you like or not, [if you are reading this] you have become part of the intensely intelligent, always telemeterized Crowd ... no one one in the Crowd is cutoff from the Crowd; ubiquitous telemetry means that every member of the Crowd is part of, or furnishing data to, the BigMachine ... we define the BigMachine as the vast internetwork of one million key developers and project leaders, one billion actively-engaged power users and at least ten billion [and increasing rapidly] networked, often passive, not-always-human user nodess.

The Crowd has become inescapable in all realms of business, education, science and government. 

Crowdliness is about enjoying Life within the Crowd ... and it's also about unplugging from the Crowd and having some semblance of a healthy life in spite of the Crowd, in the shadow of the Crowd.

Crowdliness is about an inherently social approach to living well within the Crowd. The Crowd has absolutely no need of any additional work evangelically extolling the virtues of things like artificial intelligence, the internet, microprocessors or the transistor. There's also no particular reason to advocate a more outgoing or gregaraious personality. Crowdliness assumes that your personality is not going to change AND it assumes that *progress* in technology will continue, even though many people will not see everything about technology as real progress.

Crowdliness simply assumes that the trend toward embarrassingly internetworked, massively social-network-of-social-networks, hybrid human-machie information-weighing big marketplace of interconnected marketplaces will continue unabated ... quite simply, it is hideously STUPID to live life looking in the rear view mirror hoping to go back ... ***we are not going that way*** and no amount of whining will bring about a change in direction, because ... ***The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go***.
