# The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go

We do not really understand emergent behaviors, especially when crowds of individuals are FREE to improvise. Nothing that spectacular can EMERGE from dead logic, regardless of how long the processor is left on or what kinds of memory it has access to. 

The POWER of emergence comes from LIVING systems that that don't have locked down logic, but are constantly mutating because they FREE to improvise, FREE to make mistakes but also FREE to succeed beyond anyone's wildest expectations and then FREE to learn from the best of the best coming from CROWDS of other living systems.

FREEDOM is about extensibility ... and a progression that is greater than what an individual human can see with respect to the payoffs associated with making the right moves ... free markets increase FREEDOM through crowdliness, ie the ability of the masses to imitate and build upon success and even treat that success as if it was their idea ... an emergent value is created by the crowds full of successful people reinvesting capital and being serious about their choices because they have their own skin in the game ... in this manner, FREEDOM is the rising tide that lifts all boats so completely that people take it for granted that their boat should be rising like everyone else's ... so there is also a negative emergent behavior that arises out of crowdly success, in that undeserving people have been given enough affluence that they are able to be idle and apply their loser skills to working at becoming insanely jealous and hateful of those who have succeeded.
