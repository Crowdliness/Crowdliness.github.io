# REFLECT upon your 100 days of learning

## The #100Days Plan 

0)  [Did we really follow our WHY?](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/27/Day000.html) ... can we articulate it better now?

1)  [Setting Up The Learning Sandbox](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/27/Day-1.html) ... BEFORE we start using the BIG rentable computing horsepower, let's spend some time figuring out how this stuff works and WHY we might actually need multi-node GPU clusters for a problem, ie so that we don't just squander our capital buying time for something that doesn't need it.

2) [Dev Workflow and Kernel profiling](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/28/Day-2.html) ... we build a supercomputing workflow ... that means containers and something that we can take to a much, much, much more powerful machine. 

3) [Setting the stage for computational simulation](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/28/Day-3.html) will involve taking a bit of dive into the pool of [computational chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry) and [computational chemistry software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_quantum_chemistry_and_solid-state_physics_software) ... we want to think about [scalable workflows](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00638-4)

4) [Preparations for using a packages like QUANTUM ESPRESSO](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/28/Day-4.html) To install [QUANTUM ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/documentation/) from source, we will need first of all a minimal Unix environment, that is: a command shell (e.g., bash, sh) and utilities make, awk, sed ... for our purposes, we install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, and more) using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

20) Social media and social coding are about generating interactions and sharing ideas ... it's tough to say exactly where is the best place to find people, but you won't find people in your imagination or by just continuing to listen to the same people that you have listened to ... you will need to find your own ways to meet people ... it's like kindergarten; get out there and play with those kids ... and BE KIND!

80) This milestone is about the final push toward wrapping thing thing up ... after the 100 days are done, it's either a matter of doing something new and going forward with something that might disrupt the existing ecosystem or deciding that the best approach is to put your shoulder to an existing wheel and build upon what has been been built ... the best course is generally going to be the latter, but there are a LOT of existing wheels and you should be extremely careful and quite discriminating in terms of deciding which is the best one. The process of learning something should have introduced you to the people in the world who are the very best at what can be achieved. If you genuinely don't believe these people are capable of realizing the best vision of what is possible, you disrupt ... but the best option is likely going to be continued collaboration and evangelization for success.
