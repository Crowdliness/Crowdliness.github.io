# 100 Days of learning -- Day 9

[SOMEBODY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTav7r38y-Y) ... or maybe [somebody else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6HJi0iqYbw) really should have a ***rentable*** compute / AI training workstation for their Patreon subscribers.

There's an audience of people who might have a $100, $200, $500 or $1000/month budget for some **serious** compute time ... maybe WE are part of that audience ... we take our **science** or **graph compute** hobby seriously or at least seriously enough that we have a SMALL budget to feed our aspirations of developing or leveling-up our skillset ... but our SMALL budget is not going to be more than $1000/month -- it might not even be $100/month ... but we will need *some time* on genuinely powerful workstations, but we do not really need *24x365 always-immediately-available mission-critical business-level* time, although we might want that for our little learning sandboxes ... so why isn't [some tech who builds systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hxr9k5Vdc4) offering time [by the day, hour or minute] on something like a $1,000,000 monster workstation as a $2500/day or $100/hr reservable, possibly interruptible service?

Well ... *maybe someone is offering this as a service* ... or, if not this, there's probably something pretty close and probably even better, right?

Let's see what's out there ... sure, we always need to be looking for the freebies, FIRST ... but, at some point, we should not be afraid to pay *something* to RENT some genuine power.
