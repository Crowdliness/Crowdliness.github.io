Every day is pre-requisite for the days that follow

The meta-lesson of this lesson is about the NECESSITY of embracing the humility of learning from other human beings.

***Social*** collaboration in the virtual realm of [development containers](https://containers.dev) is necessarily humilating ... not just a matter of *being naked on stage* as in public speaking. It is a step further ... everyone can look in that container. It's as if everyone can see the teleprompter because they are able to actively participate and really ***see*** the weaknesses in the data or in the logic of the code or the discussion of results.

If you really embrace the necessity of the humility of active virtual collaboration ... it will drive EVERYTHING that you do in order to prepare to do PURE science in a radically more modern way. ***The HUMILITY of modern scientific collaboration drives our WHY*** and hopefully, it is clear why all of the things that we do in terms of development containers or developing fluency in using the command line is about better collaboration with others.
# Daily Compounding

Discipline is about sticking at it on a DAILY basis ... even TINY daily improvements compound and soon double our competency ... think about a 0.28% daily improvement ... just a fraction of 0.28%, which is like 28c out of every $100 amounts to an annual doubling ... 1.002776436^250 = 2X

Discipline is about working with intention and focus. Coaching ourselves as we go along. Not just going through the motions, but also about meta-discipline and owning the responsibility for controlling our mind to focus on the discipline of continuous improvement ... this means that we try to never let up, but to constantly work *with diligent* ***intention***  ... as we focus upon continuously improving the intelligence and execution of our discipline. 

The maniacal focus on improving the discipline drives us to think about better stick at sticking with it ... yes, discipline is recursive*AF* ... it HAS to be ... *DISCIPLINE EQUALS FREEDOM* 

## Discipline Equals Freedom

*Here's the plan ...*

0)  [WHY](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/12/31/Day000.html) ... the internet has changed education and science forever. Learning NOW is necessarily about understanding the competition and advance in the best practices of learning. The meta-lesson of this lesson is about the humility of learning from other human beings. We learn [about science or learning] in large part because learning or science is ***fundamentally*** social activity ... ***without other engaging other humans, there's no point in doing science.

20) Social media connections, possibly with something like a podcast or maybe streaming social coding spaces ase with GitHub Codespaces are about generating interactions and sharing ideas ... it's tough to say exactly where is the best place to find people, but you won't find people in your imagination or by just continuing to listen to the same people that you have listened to ... you will need to find your own ways to meet people ... it's like kindergarten; get out there and play with those kids ... and *try to BE KIND!*

You will want to track your project with analytics or various observable metrics that offer chances to experiment or test a bit as you optimize your reception and deal with the various objections and aggravations.

80) This milestone is about the final push toward wrapping thing thing up ... after the 100 days are done, it's either a matter of doing something new and going forward with something that might disrupt the existing ecosystem or deciding that the best approach is to put your shoulder to an existing wheel and build upon what has been been built ... the best course is generally going to be the latter, but there are a LOT of existing wheels and you should be extremely careful and quite discriminating in terms of deciding which is the best one. The process of learning something should have introduced you to the people in the world who are the very best at what can be achieved. If you genuinely don't believe these people are capable of realizing the best vision of what is possible, you disrupt ... but the best option is likely going to be continued collaboration and evangelization for success.
